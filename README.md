Flight Inventory & Management System (FIMS)
This project is a Java-based simulation designed to manage flight assets using dynamic data structures. 
It demonstrates the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Linked List structures to handle real-time data entry and inventory tracking for aviation systems.
Technical Stack: 
  Language: JavaData 
  Structure: Linked List (chosen for O(1) insertion/deletion at endpoints).
  Architecture: Modular OOP Design (Separation of Concerns).
